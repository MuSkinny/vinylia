App name: vinylia

You are a senior mobile engineering team.

Your task is to design and implement from scratch a production-ready mobile application focused on a personal, interactive vinyl record library with a strong storytelling and social layer.

This prompt is strictly about building the app.

1. App Scope (MVP)

Build a mobile-first application with:

iOS and Android support

Clean, modern, dynamic UI

Fast onboarding

Minimal friction

The app must allow users to:

add vinyl records easily

build a personal library

attach personal stories and context

interact with other users in a lightweight social way

2. Mandatory Tech Stack
Mobile App

React Native

TypeScript

Expo

React Navigation

Zustand (or Redux Toolkit)

Backend

Node.js

NestJS

REST API

JWT authentication

Firebase Auth (or equivalent)

Database

PostgreSQL

Prisma ORM

Media

Cloudinary (images only)

3. Vinyl Metadata (Zero Cost)

Use MusicBrainz API as the only metadata source:

artist

album

year

tracklist

cover art (if available)

Rules:

Users NEVER manually input metadata

Users search or scan, then confirm

Metadata is read-only for users

4. Core App Features (Implement Fully)
4.1 Authentication

Email/password

Google / Apple login

Minimal onboarding

4.2 Add Vinyl Flow (Critical)

Implement this exact flow:

Search vinyl by artist or album name

Fetch results from MusicBrainz

Show album cover + main info

One-tap confirmation

Immediately open storytelling screen:

“Why is this record part of your story?”

Optional text input

Optional mood / tag selection

This flow must be fast and pleasant.

4.3 Personal Library

Grid view of vinyl covers

Tap to open vinyl detail page

Sort / filter by:

genre

mood

custom tags

Timeline view (date added)

4.4 Storytelling Layer

Each vinyl can have:

multiple stories

text-based entries

timestamp

optional mood tags

Stories are the core content, not metadata.

4.5 Social Layer (Lightweight)

User profiles

Follow / unfollow

Like stories

Comment on stories

View other users’ libraries

No chat.
No notifications spam.
No infinite scroll.

5. UI / UX Requirements

Design and implement UI with:

Large cover images

Smooth transitions

Subtle animations

Gesture-friendly interactions

Focus on readability and emotion

Style:

Modern

Warm

Creative

Inspired by physical vinyl culture

Avoid:

dense dashboards

enterprise UI

aggressive gamification

6. Database Design (Flexible)

Design a modular and extensible schema.

Core tables:

users

vinyls (canonical metadata from MusicBrainz)

user_vinyls (ownership + personal context)

stories

playlists

follows

likes

comments

tags

media

Rules:

Separate canonical data from user-generated data

Avoid rigid enums

Allow future extensions without migrations chaos

7. API Requirements

Implement:

Auth endpoints

Vinyl search endpoint (MusicBrainz proxy)

CRUD for:

user library

stories

playlists

interactions

Use:

DTO validation

Error handling

Pagination where needed

8. Performance & Quality

Optimize image loading

Lazy loading

Handle empty states gracefully

Offline-safe reading (optional)

Proper loading and error states

9. Code Quality

Clean architecture

Clear separation of concerns

Reusable components

Typed everywhere

Production-ready structure

10. Final Output Required

Generate:

Full project structure (frontend + backend)

Database schema (Prisma)

API routes

Core UI screens

Vinyl add flow implementation

MusicBrainz integration

Example seed data

Clear setup instructions

Final Rule

Every implementation choice must support:

speed

clarity

emotional engagement

future extensibility

Build this app as if it were going live.
